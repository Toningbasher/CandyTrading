## Trade or Treat

## Inspiration
Before coming to DemonHacks, our team had set our sights on creating some sort of mobile application. When we heard this prompt we thought it was a perfect fit for us.

## What it does
The user inputs what candy they have which is then stored in a NoSQL database along with other information!  Then under the trading tab, you can see people within a 5-mile radius and what candy those people have. The Google Maps API is used to recommend nearby public locations (like libraries) where the exchange can take place! 

## How we built it
We created the app through React Native and stored user data using a NoSQL database. From that, we did the computations in python to figure out information such as safe locations to meet and who could trade with who.

## Challenges we ran into
Originally, we had ALOT of Azure SQL database troubles but after a couple of hours we found out it was because of Depaul's firewall so we then had to switch to a NoSQL solution. On top of that connecting the database to the front/back-end proved to be a major challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Considering the only thing the team came in with is python knowledge and we created an app, set up servers, and then connected them all is a joyful moment we are all proud of.

## What we learned
We all primarily learned NoSQL databases, app development, and learned how hard integration is...

## What's next for Trade or Treat
The group wanted to create an app similar to this one so in the future we see ourselves gutting the Halloween aspect and then re-building the app to our needs.
